| Concordia University's 7th Hackathon | January 21, 2023 - January 22, 2023 | [IN-PERSON in Montreal] John Molson School of Business, 1450 Guy St, Montreal, Quebec H3H 0A1 | Specific Selected Sponsor Challenge:  The company 'Nventive' challenged hackers to create an application that improves the user's life and the experience of a mobile application, implementing features specific to a Smart Watch: preferably an Apple Watch. |

## Inspiration
I personally faced the tediousness and inefficiency of manually logging my phyiscal activity sessions on the default 'Notes' app on my Apple mobile device; takes time away from more fun! If only there was a way to add a quick entry in a press of a button so I can focus on staying physically active before I lose the motivation to move. With inspriation from past personal and school projects I was inspired to try and challenge myself further: try to develop in IOS for the first time and learn.

## MoveToImprove Application
MoveToImprove is a SmartWatch application used to automatically record and log one's physical activity session; this is a proof of concept design that experimented into using the built-in sensors the smart watch device provides.

### Tools and Technology Used
- IDE: Xcode
- Language: Swift (Native)
- Framework: SwiftUI
- WatchOS (Operating System that runs on the Apple Watch)
- Apple Watch Model Designed/Emulated with: Apple Watch SE (2nd Edition) 44mm

### Challenges Faced
Foreign Domain/Technology/Environment:
- Never used an Apple Watch/Smart Watch before
- First time developing in IOS
- Downtime in setup of tools and envrionment required: Xcode (HUGE download), watchOS. This was mainly due to the slow network connectivity which resulted in the usage of my personal hotspot instead.
- Clash of incompatible approaches/versioning and libraries upon developing, resulting in stunted development and reducing my original ambitious goals (Specific knowledge limitations resulting in time set aside for research instead of development)
- Unexpected last minute solo working and time constraints
- Requires a paid IOS developer account in order to test with the real hardware devices in real life (Possible to test via emulators but is very limiting in terms of experimenting and testing with the built-in hardware sensors using just the emulators)
