| Concordia University's 7th Hackathon | January 21, 2023 - January 22, 2023 | [IN-PERSON in Montreal] John Molson School of Business, 1450 Guy St, Montreal, Quebec H3H 0A1 | Specific Selected Sponsor Challenge:  The company 'Nventive' challenged hackers to create an application that improves the user's life and the experience of a mobile application, implementing features specific to Smart Watch: preferably an Apple Watch. |

## Inspiration
I personally faced the tediousness and inefficiency of manually logging my phyiscal activity on the default 'Notes' app on my Apple mobile device. If only there was a way to add a quick entry in a press of a button so I can focus on staying physically active before I lose the motivation. There was also inspriation from past personal and school projects that inspired me to try and challenge myself. 

## MoveToImprove Application
MoveToImprove is a SmartWatch application used to automatically record and log one's physical activity session: using the built-in sensors the smart watch device provides.


### Tools and Technology
- Xcode
- Swift
- SwiftUI
- WatchOS
- Apple Watch SE (2nd Edition) 44mm

### Challenges Faced
Foreign Domain/Technology/Environment:
- Never used an Apple Watch/Smart Watch before
- First time developing in IOS
- Downtime in setup of tools and envrionment required: Xcode, watchOS. This was mainly due to the slow network connectivity which results in the usage of my personal hotspot instead.
- Clash of eligible libraries upon developing, resulting in less ambitious goals (Specific knowledge limitations which forced me to just learn)
- Unexpected solo working and time constraints
